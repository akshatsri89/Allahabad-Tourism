Also known as the Naini Bridge, the New Yamuna Bridge is among India’s longest cable-stayed bridges. It runs across the Yamuna River in the North-South direction, connecting Prayagraj to Naini. It was constructed in the year 2004 to minimize the traffic congestions over the old Naini Bridge. The construction of the bridge was a joint responsibility of the Hindustan Construction Company and Hyundai Engineering and Construction.

The New Yamuna Bridge is also the first six-lane bridge in India built with modern design and structure. It has two pylons, made up of concrete material, that provide support to the major part of the deck of the bridge held together by steel cables. The bridge also acts as a road link between Prayagraj and NH-27 stretching across for 370 meters. The modern technology combined with environmental compatibility and excellent quality make for some of the features of this bridge that offer great benefits. India has a stupendous network of bridges and this bridge is a fine example of the country’s tremendous growth in infrastructure.
