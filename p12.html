          <p align="center"><big><big> All Saints Cathedral in Prayagraj was built in the late 19th century and today stands remarkably as a colonial structure. The intricate work and designs on the marble altar and the stained glass panel with the grand pulpit along with its arches in pale sandstone makes the building more attractive. The Anglican Church has a Gothic style of architecture, which makes it a major tourist attraction in Prayagraj. All Saints Cathedral Church is also referred to as “Patthar Girja” (Stone Church). This landmark was designed by the British architect Sir William Emerson, in the year 1870. The church is located at the Sarojini Naidu Marg, Civil Lines, Prayagraj, and is open only on Sundays from dawn to dusk.</big></big></p>
