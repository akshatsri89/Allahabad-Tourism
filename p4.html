          <p align="center"><big><big> The Allahabad Museum located in the Chandra Shekhar Azad Park (Company Bagh) is among the National level museums of India. A well-kept repository of historical artefacts, paintings, sculptures and photographs sprawl across galleries of the museum. There is a striking statue of freedom fighter Chandra Shekhar Azad twirling his moustaches outside the red -bricked building. The museum is about 3 kms from Allahabad railway junction and almost equidistant from Prayag and Rambagh Railway Stations and about 12 km from Bamrauli Airport. The beautiful location, large sprawling green lawn and nicely laid out garden has given it a special attraction. It was originally established under the aegis of Prayagraj Municipality in 1931 with a small collection of model of birds and animals. In the same complex lies the Gandhi Smriti Vahan which was used to carry the ashes of Gandhi to the Sangam.
