It is said that anyone who prays at this tree or dies under it attains salvation. The boundary of the fort is 15 feet away from the tree, and its branches hang out into the Yamuna river. In 1992, marble was laid around the tree, and in 1999 a small temple was made near it with the statues of Ram, Lakshman and Sita. About 22 meters of cloth is used in wrapping around the tree near its roots. The Akshay Vat, or the eternal tree that is indestructible. It is said that Lord Ram had spent a night near this tree while on his way to the wilds. It is also a holy site for the Jains. Permission has to be sought from Army officials to visit this tree.</big></big></p>
