          <p align="center"><big><big> The massive fort built by Emperor Akbar in 1583 A.D. stands on the banks of the Yamuna, close to the confluence site. In its prime, the fort was unrivalled for its design, construction and craftsmanship. This huge, majestic fort has three magnificent galleries flanked by high towers. At present it is used by the army and only a limited area is open to visitors. The magnificent outer wall is intact and rises above the water’s edge. Visitors are allowed to see the Ashokan Pillar and Saraswati Koop, a well said to be the source of the Saraswati river and Jodhabai Palace. The gigantic Ashoka pillar of polished sandstone stands 10.6 meters high, dating back to 232 B.C. The pillar has several edicts and a Persian inscription of Emperor Jahangir inscripted on it, commemorating his accession to the throne.
The Patalpuri temple and the much revered Akshaya Vat or immortal Banyan tree are also great attractions for the faithful. Within this underground temple, inside the fort, lies the Akshaya Vat – or the immortal tree. Believed to have been visited by Lord Rama, the temple was also seen by the famous Chinese traveler and writer Hiuen Tsang during his visit to this place.</big></big></p>
